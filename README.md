## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I'm a computer science student at the Technical University of Munich.

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on getting into the practical source 'Open Source Lab' (please take me <3)
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use github
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on HomeAssistant, CuraEngine and Klipper
- âš¡ Fun fact: it's not a typo
